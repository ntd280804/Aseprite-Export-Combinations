## 🧩 Script Included

Here is the current script available:

- [**Export Combinations**](https://github.com/ntd280804/AsepriteExportcombinations/wiki/Export-Combinations)  
  Exports each layer in combination with tags. Optional grouping, scaling, custom naming, and support for PNG/GIF/JPG.

While some options may look advanced, **everything has sensible default values** — just run and go!  
If you want finer control over export naming or grouping, the script allows for deep customization.

> 💡 **Note:** After running, Aseprite may mark your file as "unsaved".  
> No actual changes are made unless clearly stated by the script.
