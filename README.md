## 🧪 **Batch Export Test**
- ✅ Layer groups: 7 (total 8 layers)
- ✅ Nested tags: 68
> 🎯 Total spritesheets exported: 544

## 📐 **Formula**

The formula to calculate exported spritesheets is:

> **Total spritesheets** = 𝐿 × 𝑇 = 8 × 68 = 544
- L = total number of layers
- T = total number of tags

## 🧩 Script Included

Here is the current script available:

- [**Export Combinations**](https://github.com/ntd280804/AsepriteExportcombinations/wiki/Export-Combinations)  
  Exports each layer in combination with tags. Optional grouping, scaling, custom naming, and support for PNG/GIF/JPG.

While some options may look advanced, **everything has sensible default values** — just run and go!  
If you want finer control over export naming or grouping, the script allows for deep customization.

> 💡 **Note:** After running, Aseprite may mark your file as "unsaved".  
> No actual changes are made unless clearly stated by the script.
